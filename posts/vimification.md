Like most developers, I have been through many iterations of my Development Environment. I started like many at University with Notepad++, moving the Adobe Brackets and on to WebStorm.

Of course there was smatterings of Visual Studio in there; but, for my sins, I have spent a fair amount of time at University & in my first job developing C++ & C#, neither of which I'm too keen on developing in Notepad++.

## Webstorm bits

## VS Code

VS Code was my next move. Again it was a perfectly fine IDE. It has a _bunch_ of useful itegrations, mostly with Microsoft products such as Azure and (recently) GitHub, and it's joint, remote coding tools that allow multiple developers to pair remotely is an absolute revelation.

It has great tooling for TypeScript and, as with all things these days, a fantastic plugin community and good customisation.

It's customisable to a high degree

## Vim (NeoVim)

The move to Vim
