### Build Plugins

Can't play with it today. #RFC

Edge Handlers

Allow you to write code, build & deploy it in to the edge network

Could allow you to do authentication & redirection, personalisation etc.

It's awesome. Can't wait to give it a go.

## Prismic

This is fucking awesome.

Previously wasn't a big fan of the "Slices" but I'm starting to see the benefit
of them as a developer

They sync your slices _to_ Prismic so that you can source control your slice
configuration. Also you can code in one place and configure your content from
there.
