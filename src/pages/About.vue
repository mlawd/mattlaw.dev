            We don’t serve their kind here! What? Your droids. They’ll have to
            wait outside. We don’t want them here. Listen, why don’t you wait
            out by the speeder. We don’t want any trouble. I heartily agree with
            you sir.

            Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn’t like you. I’m sorry. I don’t
            like you either You just watch yourself. We’re wanted men. I have
            the death sentence in twelve systems. I’ll be careful than. You’ll
            be dead. This little one isn’t worth the effort. Come let me buy you
            something…

            The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight
            down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area
            is only two meters wide. It’s a small thermal exhaust port, right
            below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.
            A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the
            station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft
            is ray-shielded, so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes. That’s
            impossible, even for a computer. It’s not impossible. I used to
            bull’s-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They’re not much
            bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with
            you!
